## Who I Am as a Learner 🏆📚

- I **learn fast and apply even faster** – I like to move from concept → code as quickly as possible.
- I thrive in environments where **clarity, structure, and systems thinking** matter.
- I’m neurodivergent in a way that makes pattern-spotting, refactoring, and process design feel natural.
- I ~love~ taking bulk information and turning it into **wildly efficient, scalable systems**.

## Profile Summary 👩👑

> *“Hi, I’m Amber. I’m an early-career data engineer in training, currently completing IBM’s Data Engineering program and building Python projects focused on data pipelines and architecture. My background is in cross-functional production (creative industries, Microsoft, Google, PBS, just to name a few) and problem solving, and my strengths are systems thinking, clear communication, and improving messy processes. I’m looking for roles where I can help design and maintain data pipelines, support analytics teams, and grow toward data warehousing, architecture and platform design.”*
