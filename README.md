# Python Learning 2025

Hands-on practice space for my transition into **Data Engineering** and **Data Warehouse Architect**.

I’m using this repo to document my learning and build real, reusable code snippets as I go.

---

## Current Focus

- IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate (Coursera)
- Python for Data Science, AI & Development
- Building strong foundations in:
  - Python
  - Data pipelines and ETL
  - Databases and data warehousing
  - Cloud & MLOps (later in the journey)

## Badges & Credentials

- 🎓 **IBM Data Engineering Essentials** (via Coursera, issued by IBM / Credly)  
  – Badge 1/16 of the full IBM Professional in Data Engineering certificate 
  – Covers data engineering roles, data pipelines, databases, data repositories, and big data basics.

## Who I Am as a Learner

- I **learn fast and apply even faster** – I like to move from concept → code as quickly as possible.
- I thrive in environments where **clarity, structure, and systems thinking** matter.
- I’m neurodivergent in a way that makes pattern-spotting, refactoring, and process design feel natural.
- I ~love~ taking bulk information and turning it into **wildly efficient, scalable systems**.

## Profile / Interview Summary (draft)

> *“Hi, I’m Amber. I’m an early-career data engineer in training, currently completing IBM’s Data Engineering program and building Python projects focused on data pipelines and architecture. My background is in cross-functional production (creative industries, Microsoft, Google, PBS, just to name a few) and problem solving, and my strengths are systems thinking, clear communication, and improving messy processes. I’m looking for roles where I can help design and maintain data pipelines, support analytics teams, and grow toward data warehousing architecture and platform design.”*

## Notebooks & Practice Code

See the [`notebooks/`](./notebooks) folder for:

## Python Practice Notebooks

- 🔤 **Strings & Variables Practice** → [View Notebook](./notebooks/strings_practice.ipynb)
- 🧩 **Profile Statement Functions** → [View Notebook](./notebooks/profile_statements.ipynb)

- (More coming as I progress through the labs)

This repo will grow as I move through each module – it’s a live record of my learning progress and growth.
